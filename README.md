# About LittleLink (Mono)
LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplateâ€”we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. ðŸ˜Š

LittleLink has more than 20 company button styles you can use and we'll be throwing more in soon. You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go. Not a fan of the colors? Update `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing. You can also set your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css`, which will use the system theme of the device you visit on.

Using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) let us build something that loads quickly & doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity. LittleLink scored a 99/100 in performance when tested with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).
